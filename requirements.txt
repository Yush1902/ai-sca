To fix the vulnerabilities, we need to sanitize the inputs that are used in subprocess.run. This can be achieved by using a list of strings instead of a string, and avoid shell command.

In scripts/git_ops.py, the code at line 7 and line 18 should be updated from subprocess.run(some_variable) to subprocess.run(['command', 'arg1', 'arg2'])

Here is a secure requirements.txt:

1. A secure `requirements.txt` should be updated with the latest secure versions of the dependencies.

2. Ensure none of the dependencies or transitive dependencies are deprecated or abandoned.

3. Avoid using dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.

4. Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities associated with your dependencies.

Unfortunately, I can't generate a specific `requirements.txt` for you as I don't have the details of the dependencies of your project. Here is an example of how it should be:

```
Flask==1.1.4
Jinja2==2.11.3
MarkupSafe==1.1.1
Werkzeug==1.0.1
```

Remember, every dependency should be pinned to a specific version. This avoids the risk of automatically upgrading packages that depend upon other packages, and potentially breaking software or creating a security risk. 

It's also recommended to frequently check and upgrade the packages for the newer versions with the possible security patches. This could be done manually or by using automated tools and services. 

Please note, that all changes should be properly tested to ensure they don't break existing functionality.
